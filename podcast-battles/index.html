        <p>
          The original idea behind our podcast was to talk about (mostly
          negative) effects of generative AI in general, exploring societal,
          environmental, and cognitive issues. While researching, we decided
          this was far too much to naturally fit into a 10 minute window, and
          narrowed it down to a cognitive / educational scope. I liked the
          research that we did, and the actual content in the podcast was good
          and aligned with our idea. I feel like the delivery could have been a
          little better. Thinking in hindsight, some of the genuine
          conversations between my partner and I while researching would have
          probably fit better into the podcast than what we actually recorded
          for it.

          Creating the AI version was surprisingly difficult. As one of our
          sources was significantly larger than the others, Google's NotebookLM
          decided it was the only relevant source, and completely ignored the
          others in its creation. Trying to do anything in a "Debate" format led
          to hilarious results, featuring Character A reading statistics
          directly from the study, and Character B outright accusing them of
          lying while making up nonsensical rebuttals... for 14 minutes
          straight. It really solidifies my claim in our version about how AI
          should not be used "on it's own" / without an intermediary. We ended
          up generating a script with ChatGPT, voicing it using a free
          ElevenLabs model, and editing it together to ChatGPT's exact
          specifications.

          As for a comparison, the human and AI versions of the podcast turned
          out surprisingly similar. Our podcast started with the negative
          effects of AI, as they are most prominent in the traditional school
          format, and then pivotted to talking about its positive applications,
          and how the issues may be alleviated by properly adopting AI in the
          classroom and teaching students how to use it "correctly" instead of
          cutting it out entirely. The AI podcast started by talking about AI
          usage as a tutor in classrooms,
          <i>almost as if it were already widely adopted,</i> and then addressed
          briefly how misusing it could be harmful at the end.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The AI version shared our weakness of not really being able to
          simulate a conversation, and maybe the lesson to be learned from this
          is that that's very hard, if not impossible in a work where all of the
          lines were prepared ahead of time. Even when the answers to questions
          weren't scripted, they still seemed like they were as we had ample
          amounts of time to think about them and internalize a response. If I
          were to do this project again, maybe I would have my partner and I
          research our topics in complete isolation, and then actually discuss
          what we learned blindly for 10-20 minutes on recording.
